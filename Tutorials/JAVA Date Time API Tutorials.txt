JAVA 8 Date and Time API :
Until java 1.7 if we want to represent Date and Time values, then we were using
java.util.Date, java.util.Calender, Timestamp classes which were not very effiecient w.r.t.
performance and convinience.

So New Java Date and Time API of JAVA 8, we can overcome this problem.
Some of the classes are depricated and it is suggsted to use new JODA apis.

1. How to represent Current system date :
	LocalDate date = LocalDate.now();

2. How to represent Current system Time :

	LocalTime date = LocalTime.now();

import java.time.*;
public class Test
{
	public static void main(String args[])
	{
		// To represent Current system Date 
		LocalDate date = LocalDate.now();
		System.out.println("Current System date is : "+date);
		
		// To represent current system time
		LocalTime time = LocalTime.now();
		System.out.println("Current System Time is : "+time);

		// To get Day, month and Year from Date
		LocalDate date1 = LocalDate.now();
		int dd = date1.getDayOfMonth();
		int mm = date1.getMonthValue();
		int yyyy = date1.getYear();
		
		System.out.println("Date in our own format is : "+dd+"..."+mm+"..."+yyyy); // printing our own format
		System.out.printf("%d-%d-%d", dd, mm, yyyy);
	
	}
