################### Docker ################### 
Dockeris a containarization platform which packages your applications and all it's dependencies together
in the form of containers, so as to ensure that the application works seemlesly in any environment(dev, uat or Prod).

Container : Heance container contains a complete ecosystem of your project- including the appli-
cation, it's dependencies and everything which is needed for an application to run on Server.

This guarantes that the software will always run the same, regardless of it's environment.

Flow :
1. create a Docker file.
2. build the docker file using docker build ,then image is created(read only).
3. run the image, the container will be created(also called runnable instance of an image).

########################### Docker File ##########################################
Q. What is Docker File :
This is a text file which provides a set of instructions to build a Docker image, including 
- operating system
- languages,
- Env. variables,
- file locations, 
- network ports,
- and any other components need to run a docker image.

Each time a command is run in Docker file, a new layer is created in top of the previous layer. 
This allows Docker Images to be build incrementally. 
----------------------
############ Docker Image ################
When we run the docker file the Docker Image will be created :
Docker Images are the read-only templates used to build containers. 
Images also contains metadata that describes the container's capabilities and needs.

* Create a docker image suing command 'docker build'. 
* Whenever we pass the DockerFile to the docker build command, then the Docker deamon will 
create a Docker image according to the docker file instructions.
* Docker Files can not be executed by themselves and can not run or start.
  It is just a blueprint for creating docker containers.
