Apache KAFKA : 
1. Apache Kafka is A msg queue for sending the data from
 one application to other application.(from producer to Consumer).
 Apache Kafka is going to act as a msg Queue to exchange the data.

Why Msg queue System:
Problem: Collecting all the data is not easy as data is generated from the
	different sources and in various formats(json, img, txt, vdos etc.).
	Creating the different pipelining system, it is very difficult to exchange the data.
Solution :  By Using the messaging system, we can store and exchange the data 
	from different sources to the different applications.
So the msg queue will act as a mediator to exchange the data.

Publishers : The application which are generating the data are called publishers.
Subscribers : The applications which are taking the data from the msg queue are called the Subscribers.
Apache Kafka WORKS ON publishers subscribers model.

Apache Kafka is a distributed streaming platform.

# APIs available in Kafka :
1. Producer API -> it is used to store the data to the Kafka
2. Consumer API -> it is used to take the data from the Kafka
3. Streams API  -> it is used to create the pipeline to take the data from the streams of data
4. Connector API-> it is used to establish the connection witht the Kafka.

Serializer : Converting the Java object into the Json format.
De-Serializer : Converting the Json format into the Java object.

KAFKA Practical :
1. Install kafka and Zookeeper
2. run zookeeper : zookeeper-server-start.bat C:\Users\Rohit_G\Downloads\Kafka\config\zookeeper.properties
3. run kafka :  kafka-server-start.bat C:\Users\Rohit_G\Downloads\Kafka\config\server.properties
4. create a kafka topic : kafka-topics.bat --create --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --replication-factor 1 --partitions 1 --topic my-demo-topic
** --replication-factor 1** - How many copies of the topic we want to create is defined by the replication factor(Once the consumer comsumes the topic then it will be deleted from the msg queue).
5. List Topics created : kafka-topics.bat --list --bootstrap-server localhost:9092
 
-----------------------------
Produce msg on Topic : 
C:\Users\Rohit_G\Downloads\Kafka\bin\windows>kafka-console-producer.bat --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --topic customer
Message : > Welcome to my first topic from Kafka Producer

Check message on consumer : C:\Users\Rohit_G\Downloads\Kafka\bin\windows>kafka-console-consumer.bat --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --topic customer --from-beginning
Response message : 
Welcome to my first topic from Kafka Producer
